# distance calculator app

This application uses [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) compiler.

Due to the nature of the application, sadly, JavaScript is mandatory for this app to function.

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*

## Get started

Navigate to project folder:

`cd dwp-techtest`

install the dependencies:

`npm install` or `yarn install`

then start the server:

`npm run dev` or `yarn dev`

You should see your app up and running in a browser. (if does not, navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080))

## Side note

This spins up two servers, one for front-end (running on port `8080`) and other for back-end (running on port `8888`) 

The back-end's purpose is to act as a proxy to overcome `same-origin` policy
